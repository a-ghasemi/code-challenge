url: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water

* I guess the greedy algorithm can retrieve wrong answer in some cases. then I keep the bruteforce answer model to check some possibilities in the futuer.
* I prefer to use Factory Method Pattern and add some more solutions. like a Genetic Algorithm solution for this challenge"
